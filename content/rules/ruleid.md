## Why do rule IDs matter?

Each rule added to a ModSecurity instance must have a unique ID (in
recent versions of modsec). As a result of this it is important that IDs
be generated in a preplanned way such that they don\'t overlap with
other rules. This becomes particularly important when it comes to
rulesets, like OWASP CRS. Because CRS can be used with other rule sets
(in fact it is designed to be used with the Trustwave commercial rules,
for instance) it is important that no two rulesets have overlapping ID
ranges. To aid in this process the project maintains a list of reserved
ID spaces. If you are planning on publishing rules or a ruleset please
reach out to security\[ at \]modsecurity.org and we can reserve a range
of IDs for you thank you.

### ID Reservations

|----------|--------------|
| 1-99,999 | reserved for local (internal) use. Use as you see fit but do not use this range for rules that are distributed to others. |
| 100,000--199,999 | reserved for rules published by Oracle |
| 200,000--299,999 | reserved for rules published Comodo |
| 300,000-399,999 | reserved for rules published at gotroot.com |
| 400,000--419,999 | unused **(available for reservation)** |
| 420,000-429,999 | reserved for ScallyWhack  |
| 430,000--439,999 | reserved for rules published by Flameeye |
| 440,000-599,999 | unused **(available for reservation)** |

| 700,000-799,999 | reserved for Ivan Ristic |
| 900,000-999,999 | reserved for the OWASP CRS project |

### IDs in the OWASP CRS

ID's within the OWASP CRS (CRS) have special meaning. Rules
are assigned an ID based on their location within the ruleset. As the
list above notes, OWASP CRS is assigned ID's from 900,000
to 999,999. This means that each rule file in CRS 3.x has 1000 IDs
reserved for it. Currently, this is more than enough space, however, if
at some point this becomes a problem we'll cross that bridge when we
come to it. By design rules will always be separated by 10 IDs from the
ID before it. The first 10 ID's (000
010,020,030,040,050,060,070,080,090) are designated for control flow
related rules, that is typically rules that will trigger a skip action
(these will be at the beginning of a file or rules that pass). As a
result of this structure most rule files will start with ID
9\[File_ID\]100. As new rules are developed they should be added at the
end. If it becomes necessary to add a rule in-between existing rules
this must be noted in the comments.

### Mapping 3.0.0-dev(2.x) IDs to 3.0.0-rc1 IDs

When we started developing CRS 3 we started with our old ModSecurity 2.x
rules and used our experience to redesign the layout of the ruleset,
refine rules that were failing, and add new controls that were needed.
As a result of this in pre-release version of 3.x we ran into problems
where rule IDs were all of the place. Not only was this confusing but it
restricted the ability to do range based ID exclusions easily. As a
result we re-structured the rule ID\'s to what we see above.

However, this is problematic for people who have made exceptions based
on these existing rules. For these people we provide the following
table:

See [2.x to 3.x Rule ID Transition Table]({{% resource-ref "data/IdNumbering.csv" %}})

You can use the above file along with a script similar to the one below
to update exclusions or rule changes:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import csv
import argparse
import os
import sys

idTranslationFile = "IdNumbering.csv"

if(not os.path.isfile(idTranslationFile)):
    sys.stderr.write("We were unable to locate the ID translation CSV (idNumbering.csv) please place this is the same directory as this script\n")
    sys.exit(1)
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="A program that takes in an exceptions file and renumbers all the ID to match OWASP CRS 3.0-rc1 numbers. Output will be directed to STDOUT and can be used to overwrite the file using '>'")
parser.add_argument("-f", "--file", required=True, action="store", dest="fname", help="the file to be renumbered")
args = parser.parse_args()
if(not os.path.isfile((args.fname).encode('utf8'))):
    sys.stderr.write("We were unable to find the file you were trying to upate the ID numbers in, please check your path\n")
    sys.exit(1)
fcontent = ""
try:
    f = open((args.fname).encode('utf-8'), "r")
    try:
        fcontent = f.read()
    finally:
        f.close()
except IOError:
    sys.stderr.write("There was an error opening the file you were trying to update")

if(fcontent != ""):
    # CSV File
    f = open(idTranslationFile, 'rt')
    try:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            fcontent.replace(row[0], row[1])
    finally:
        f.close()

print fcontent
```
