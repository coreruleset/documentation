## OWASP CRS Metadata

OWASP CRS 3.x includes several pieces of metadata within rules. Not
every rule features all metadata but it is a continuing project where
possible to update this information to the best possible level. If you
see a rule without a piece of metadata that you think is warranted
please open either an [issue](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues) or a pull
request.

Tags about standards
--------------------

We try our best to outline information about the vulnerability when each
rule triggers. To that end we include metadata about where that
vulnerability type can be found in various standards. These tags are
currently prefixed with the standard type and will be capitalized. They
will NOT start with OWASP_CRS. They consist of a the standard and then
a slash to indicate the start of the data. The following standards are
supported:

-   WASCTC
-   OWASP\_TOP\_10
-   PCI

### Tags about paranoia level

Starting with version 3 we reintroduced the paranoia level concept.
For tuning purposes we wanted it to be very clear which rules are from
higher paranoia levels. As a result, any rule in a paranoia level
greater than 1 will have a `'paranoia-level'` tag. We use a forward
slash to deliminate this tag. Anything after the slash should represent
the paranoia level of that rule. For instance:

```apache
tag:'paranoia-level/2'
```

### Tags about rule classification

There are two different types of tags regarding rule classification. One
type of tag carries over from CRS 2.x and one type has been added to CRS
3. The CRS 3 version can be more explanatory and allows for the
capability to use SecRuleRemoveByTag more easily, whereas the CRS 2
versions give information in a more succinct manner and are used for
anomaly scoring purposes.

The CRS 2.x rule classifications are indicated by tags starting with
\'OWASP\_CRS\'. They are delimited by the forward slash (/) and will
always have three parts. The sections get more specific as you progress
through the string where the third section will always be the most
specific. The following are a list of all the current CRS 2.x type tags
that are used in CRS.

```apache
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/XSS'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/AUTOMATION/SECURITY_SCANNER'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/SQL_INJECTION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/SOURCE_CODE_JAVA'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/ERRORS_JAVA'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/ERRORS_SQL'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/SESSION_FIXATION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/COMMAND_INJECTION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/DIR_TRAVERSAL'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/FILE_INJECTION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/INFO_DIRECTORY_LISTING'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/INVALID_REQ'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/INVALID_HREQ'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/EVASION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/MISSING_HEADER_HOST'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/MISSING_HEADER_ACCEPT'"
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/MISSING_HEADER_UA'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/IP_HOST'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/SIZE_LIMIT'"
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/ENCODING_NOT_ALLOWED'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/HEADER_RESTRICTED'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/FILES_NOT_ALLOWED'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/EVASION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/MISSING_HEADER_ACCEPT'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/SIZE_LIMIT'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/POLICY/EXT_RESTRICTED'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/RFI'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/REQUEST_SMUGGLING'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/ERRORS_PHP'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/SOURCE_CODE_PHP'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/PHP_INJECTION'
tag:'OWASP_CRS/LEAKAGE/ERRORS_IIS'
```

The CRS 3.x type tagging is split over a series of tags:

-   application
-   language
-   platform
-   attack

These tags all have additional information specified after a dash (-).
In some cases, particularly with attack there might be another dash that
represents a more specific variant for instance attack-injection-php. In
general anything after the first dash can be treated as a string. If the
category is general for a given rule the tag will have the data
\'multi\' an example would be a vulnerability that affects many
different platforms. In this case the tag would look as follows:

```bash
tag:'platform-multi'
```

###  Additional rule information

Often we will generate rules based on some presentation or article. In
fact, sometimes the construction of the rule is done in such a way that
it might not be naively clear how the rule works. In all of these cases
comments will be left above the rule in question. Items like links will
not appear within tag data.
