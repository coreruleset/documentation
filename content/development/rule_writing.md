> From years of experience, the CRS project has assembled a wealth of knowledge and advice on how to write clear and efficient WAF rules, as this page outlines.

The CRS project's advice on rule writing is contained within the [contribution guidelines]({{% ref "contribution_guidelines.md" %}}), a document which can also be found in plain text form in CRS releases for offline reference. The guidelines contain invaluable guidance and tips on how to write rules, including:

- effective regular expression writing
- consistent formatting and indentation
- rule action order
- CRS paranoia level rule compliance
- writing rule tests

While some of the guidelines are specific to writing rules for inclusion in CRS, following the guidelines will help with the creation of *any* rule set by ensuring that rules are clear, efficient, easy to read, and easy to maintain.
