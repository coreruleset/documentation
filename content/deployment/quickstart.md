Welcome to the OWASP Core RuleSet (CRS) quickstart guide. We will
attempt to get you up and running with CRS as quick as possible. This
guide assumes ModSecurity is already working. If you are unsure see the
[extended install]({{< ref "install.md" >}}) page. Otherwise, lets jump in.

You'll first need to download the ruleset. Using a browser (or
equivalent) visit the following URL:

```sh
wget https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/archive/master.zip
```

Once this is installed extract it somewhere well known on your server.
Typically this will be in the webserver directory. We are demonstrating
with Apache below. For information on configuring Nginx or IIS see
[install]({{< ref "install.md" >}}). Additionally, while it is a
successful practice to make a new `modsecurity.d` folder as outlined
below, it isn't strictly necessary. The path scheme outlined is the
common to RHEL based operating systems, you may have to adjust the
Apache path used to match your installation.

```bash
mkdir /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d
mv coreruleset-master.zip /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/
cd /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d
unzip coreruleset-master.zip -d owasp-modsecurity-crs
```

After extracting the rule set we have to set up the main OWASP
configuration file. We provide an example configuration file as part of
the package located in the main directory: `csr-setup.conf.example`. 

(Note: Other aspects of ModSecurity are controlled by the
recommended ModSecurity configuration rules, packaged with ModSecurity)

For many people
this will be a good enough starting point but you should take the time
to look through this file before deploying it to make sure it's right
for your environment. For more information see [configuration](configuration.md).

Once you have changed any settings within the configuration file, as
needed, you should rename it to remove the .example portion

```bash
cd /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/owasp-modsecurity-crs/
mv csr-setup.conf.example csr-setup.conf
```

Only one more step! We now have to tell our web server where our rules
are. We do this by including the rule configuration files in our
httpd.conf file. Again, we are demonstrating using Apache but it is
similar on other systems see the [install](install.md) page for details.

```bash
echo 'IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/owasp-modsecurity-crs/csr-setup.conf' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
echo 'IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/owasp-modsecurity-crs/rules/*.conf' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Now that we have configured everything you should be able to restart and
enjoy using the OWASP Core Rule Set. Typically these rules will require
a bit of exception tuning, depending on your site. For more information
see [rule exclusions]({{< ref "false_positives_tuning.md" >}}). Enjoy!

```bash
systemctl restart httpd.service
```
